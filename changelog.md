## New features
* irc: Add support for spoofing query messages. #195
	* You can now see your own messages you've typed on slack/mattermost web in irc
* irc: Add PasteBufferTimeout option (send ascii-art!)
   	* See matterircd.toml.example for an example.
   	* PasteBufferTimeout specifies the amount of time in milliseconds that messages get kept in matterircd internal buffer before being sent to
   	 mattermost or slack.  Messages that will be received in this time will be concatenated together
   	 So this can be used to paste stuff like ascii-art or code.
   	 Default 0 (is disabled)
   	 Depending on how fast you type 2500 is a good number
