# Go **irc** package

Please use the [**v2** branch][v2] for new projects!

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/sorcix/irc.v1?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/sorcix/irc.v1)

## Features
Package irc allows your application to speak the IRC protocol.

 - **Limited scope**, does one thing and does it well.
 - Focus on simplicity and **speed**.
 - **Stable API**: updates shouldn't break existing software.
 - Well [documented][Documentation] code.

*This package does not manage your entire IRC connection. It only translates the protocol to easy to use Go types. It is meant as a single component in a larger IRC library, or for basic IRC bots for which a large IRC package would be overkill.*

## Usage

Please use the [**v2** branch][v2] for new projects!
